# Isolation
### In the meantime that your transaction is running other transactions may accrue and run concurrently, well are you ready for having stateless data in your transaction or not?
- usually, you don't want to read phenomena in your transaction.
- if the state of your transaction can or will be manipulated you may think that you will get unwanted results.
- **It is all about concurrent transactions that can ruin your transaction result**

### read phenomena in detail:

- #### dirty read or read phenomena
this can happen while you reading a row or anything from your database in your transaction (this is the first transaction) that another transaction (the second one) created that, **the other transaction that created the row is still in the middle of its own transaction and it has not committed yet !!!**
so the data in the first transaction is completely reliable in the other transaction causing the creation,
this means the data can be deleted (a rollback situation happens in the second transaction)
- ### non-repeatable reads
 when you read the same value in the database multiple times **but in the middle of these two readings first value gets changed**.    
 - it can be the case that you read the property and then you read that again indirectly
 - it's rare but you can have a duplicate or the same query in your transaction
- ### phantom reads
when you read some rows in db in a transaction like you getting a range in db and you make it again later in that transaction but like others example the second one is different from the first one, as you can think another concurrent transaction made that change and that change is adding some row in that range.
- you may think that the previous and current isolation levels are the same kinda; well that's why I have that problem but they are **not** of course.
- ### Lost updates
when you write something in the middle of your transaction (and you didn't commit that like all the other levels) and after that you read it again
I think you should know better by now that the data has changed it lost what you wrote
after all levels well you know what caused that; of course another concurrent transaction changes or deletes what you just wrote in the transaction and now it's gone.

- ## Isolation levels (+ sql commnad)
-  ### Read uncommitted: 
- - #### allow to see other uncommitted change from your transaction
- - #### completly without isolation
- - #### its the lowest level
- ### Read committed:
- - #### allow you to see only committed changes 
- - #### one of most the popular level
- - #### higher level compare to previous 
- ### Repeatable read:
- - #### solve non-repeatable read phenomena
- - #### the rows you read not gonna change
- - #### higher level compare to previous 
- ### Snapshot:
- - #### make snapshot of whole database in start of transaction so every query use the data that database have in the time of starting the transaction
- - #### higher than previous but not highest yet
- ### Serializable
- - ### no concurrency at all
- - ### highest level

### Transactions Overview

#### Transaction 1 (T1)
1. **Start Transaction**
2. **Debit $30 from Account A**
3. **Credit $30 to Account B**
4. **Do not commit yet**

#### Transaction 2 (T2)
1. **Start Transaction**
2. **Read Account A**
3. **Read Account B**
4. **Commit**

| Step | Transaction | Operation                           | Account A | Account B | Notes                       |
|------|--------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| 1    | T1           | Start Transaction                   | $100      | $50       |                             |
| 2    | T1           | Debit $30 from Account A            | $70       | $50       | Uncommitted change          |
| 3    | T1           | Credit $30 to Account B             | $70       | $80       | Uncommitted change          |

| 5    | T2           | Read Account A                      | $70       | $80       | Reads uncommitted data from T1 |
| 6    | T2           | Read Account B                      | $70       | $80       | Reads uncommitted data from T1 |
| 7    | T2           | Commit                              | $70       | $80       |                             |
| 8    | T1           | Rollback                            | $100      | $50       | Reverts changes             |

### Explanation

- **Step 2-3 (T1)**: Transaction 1 modifies Account A and Account B but doesn't commit the changes.
- **Step 5-6 (T2)**: Transaction 2 reads the modified values from Account A and Account B, which are uncommitted changes made by Transaction 1.
- **Step 8 (T1)**: If Transaction 1 rolls back, the changes are undone, and the state of the accounts reverts to the initial state.
- **Note:**
-**Step 8(T1) can be happen before step 7 and you may repeat the query directly or indirectly and then you notice that the value is change**

### Explanation

- **Step 2 (T1)**: Transaction 1 reads the initial value of Account A.
- **Step 4-5 (T2)**: Transaction 2 modifies Account A and commits the change.
- **Step 6 (T1)**: Transaction 1 reads Account A again and sees the updated value due to the committed changes by Transaction 2.

### Explanation

- **Step 2 (T1)**: Transaction 1 reads accounts with a balance greater than $50, initially getting one result (Account ID 1).
- **Step 4-5 (T2)**: Transaction 2 inserts a new account with a balance of $75 and commits the change.
- **Step 6 (T1)**: Transaction 1 reads the accounts again with the same query and now sees two results (Account ID 1 and Account ID 3), which includes the newly inserted row by Transaction 2.

### Phantom Read Impact

- **Inconsistent Query Results**
- **Potential Logic Errors**

### Explanation

- **Step 2 (T1)**: Transaction 1 reads the initial value of Account A ($100).
- **Step 4 (T2)**: Transaction 2 also reads the initial value of Account A ($100).
- **Step 5-6 (T1)**: Transaction 1 updates Account A by adding $50 and commits the change, resulting in Account A having $150.
- **Step 7-8 (T2)**: Transaction 2 updates Account A by subtracting $30 based on the initial read value of $100 and commits the change, resulting in Account A having $70, which overwrites the update made by T1.

### Lost Update Impact

- **Overwritten Changes**
- **Data Integrity Issues**
